     * one method for each column you want to render, keeping your package class
     * neat and organized. For example, if the class needs to process a column
     * named 'name', it would first see if a method named $this->column_name() 
     * exists - if it does, that method will be used. If it doesn't, this one will

     * need to concern itself with any column with a name of 'name'. Instead, it
     * needs to handle everything else.

     * 
     * This example also illustrates how to implement rollover actions. Actions
